## üß† Implemented Problems

### 1. Bidirectional Search
Efficient pathfinding using two simultaneous searches (forward and backward) with `matplotlib` visualization.

### 2. Robot Path Planning
Grid-based robot movement using **Breadth-First Search** with obstacle avoidance and path display.

### 3. Rubik‚Äôs Cube Solver
Heuristic A* based simplified cube-solving logic using move definitions and heuristic cost estimates.

### 4. Graph Coloring
Coloring nodes such that no adjacent nodes share the same color using greedy techniques.

### 5. Protein Folding Simulation
Simulates hydrophobic/polar protein folding using **Hill Climbing** and energy minimization.

### 6. N-Queens (CSP)
Classic **N-Queens** problem solved using backtracking and constraint satisfaction.

### 7. UCS vs A* Search
Compare **Uniform-Cost Search** and **A\*** on a weighted graph with path cost visualizations.

### 8. Heuristic Tuning
Compare **admissible vs consistent heuristics** with analysis on explored nodes and costs.

### 9. Travelling Salesman Problem
Simulated Annealing for solving TSP with interactive path plotting and distance vs. iteration graph.

### 10. Hill Climbing
Maximizing a custom mathematical function with step-wise improvement tracking.

### 11. Local Beam Search
Multi-path local optimization applied to N-Queens to demonstrate convergence behavior.

### 12. Iterative Deepening A*
IDA* in grid environment for pathfinding combining DFS depth-limited approach with A*.

### 13. Graph Search Visualizer
Interactive UI using **matplotlib buttons** to switch between BFS, DFS, and A* on a common grid.

### 14. State Representation Framework
A simple yet powerful system to model states, transitions, and simulate sequences.

### 15. Puzzle Solver Framework
Unified structure to solve and visualize:
- 8-Puzzle
- N-Queens
- Sudoku
